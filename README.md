# Java Tetris
Behold: The greatest game to __EVER__ be played: 

# __TETRIS__ 
(but its implemented poorly :D)

Yes, you heard right! this is Tetris, the thing russia ever gave us, written in everyone's favorite programming language: Java. <br>
Go run it and see those blocks *__spinning__* boiiiiiiiii.<br>
Press those buttons and seee them moooooooooove!!!!111!!1

# README
Yeah, on a more serious note, this is Tetris, running badly in a console window, all written in Java.<br>
My thoughts going into this: "Yeah, gonna be easy - __EASY__. Just some System.out.println, some System.in.read - what could go wrong"<br>
Turns out, a lot can go wrong. For example that Java has __NO__ way of just reading a f***ing button out of the box. <br>
What would've been a one- liner in any _good_ language was a full third- party library. <br>
Just to f***ing read a button.


And yes, making the blocks spin was kind of a challenge, so don't even ask. <br>

## Disclaimer
This is, again, a really really well written piece of software. I definitivly know what I am doing, like, 20% of the time.<br> 
So yeah, don't use this to drive a car or run a nuclear power plant or something. <br>
It'll go wrong (like anything java).

### TL;DR
still better than python
